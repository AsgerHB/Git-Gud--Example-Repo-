Ber. Who's there?

Fran. (R.) Nay, answer me:1 stand, and unfold2 yourself.

Ber. Long live the king!

Fran.

Bernardo?

Ber.

He.

Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.

Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

Fran. For this relief much thanks: [Crosses to L.] 'tis bitter cold,

And I am sick at heart.

Ber. Have you had quiet guard?

Fran.

Not a mouse stirring.

Ber. Well, good night.

If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,

The rivals of my watch,4 bid them make haste.

Fran. I think I hear them.â€”Stand, ho! Who's there?

Hor. Friends to this ground.

Mar.

And liegemen to the Dane.5
